This folders contains a number of data models related to the modelling of
Building and its management based on
[GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-big-data/) activities. Compared to GSMA
models, we introduced some changes and removed the `BuildingType` model.

The following entity types are supported:

-   `Building`: A Building is a human build structure where different activities
    occur related to living, working, healing and so on.
-   `BuildingOperation`: It captures automated operations that may be ongoing
    within a building.
